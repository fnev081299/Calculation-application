# Calculation-application
Calculates my grade and tells me my average and improvements

Once opened these two lists are created:
$assignment_names = ["OOP","OS","Agile 53 +  85","Analytics","Proj.M.","Structures", "AI"] 
$year_grades = [75,80,69,58,70,77,78]

Within these you can update the titles and grades. From this the code will create the graphs that show the improvements and the table with the averages and improvements.

Note:
assure the grades are in order of receiving for a better view of the student improvements.
